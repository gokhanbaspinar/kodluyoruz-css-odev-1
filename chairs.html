          <p class="chair-text">
            Mies van der Rohe designed the Barcelona chair as part of the
            Barcelona Pavilion. The German pavilion for the 1929 International
            Exposition in Barcelona. The design was inspired by the campaign
            chairs of Ancient Rome and like his Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin
            was an effort to reinterpret an ancient classical form in a modern
            way.

          <p class="chair-text">
            With their design motto 'Getting the most of the best to the
            greatest number of people for the least' Charles and Ray Eames
            designed a one piece-seat moulded to fit the shape of the human
            body. After earlier experiments with plywood and sheet aluminium
            their search led them to glass-fibre reinforced polyester resin. A
            material previously unknown in the furniture industry. The chair
            debuted at the 'Low-Cost Furniture Design' competition organised by
            the Museum of Modern Art in 1948. It was launched on the market in
            1950 as the first mass produced chair in history.

          <p class="chair-architect-name">David Adjaye, 2013</p>
          <p class="chair-text">
            David Adjaye reduces his design for the Skeleton chair to a fine
            geometric die-cast aluminum lattice. Adjaye aimed to challenge
            materiality and form in the same way he works within architecture.
            The cantilevered chair pulls off a balancing act by by connecting
            the overhanging seat with mortise and tenon joints to its legs.
